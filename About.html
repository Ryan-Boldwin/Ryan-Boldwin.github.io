<h1> Welcome to My About Me Page! </h1>
  <p id= about-me> <img id= "headshot" src="headshot.jpg" height= 200> <img id="ps4" src= "ps4.jpg" width= 200><img id= "baseball" src= "baseball.webp" width=100> <img id="me" src= "Ryan.jpg" height=250> My name is Ryan Boldwin. I am from Burlington, Vermont and this is my first semester at URI. Before URI I had attended Plymouth State University where I graduated with a degree in Physical Education in 2019.
    After graduating I enlisted in the United States Army as a military Police Officer. I was in the army from 2020 until 2022. After completing my commitment in the Army I was hired as a physical education teacher in New Hampshire. This is where I realized that teaching was not the career I wanted pursue and I had recently gotten into coding and the science of computer languages. 
    After My wife had been accepted to URI for the Chemistry PHD program I decided that I would switch my career projectory and obtain another degree, this time Computer Sciences!
    I played baseball at Plymouth and still love baseball very much! I also really enjoy playing many different kinds of video games!  </p>
